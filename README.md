# Alkaline 🧪

[Demo](https://alkaline-theme.xyz/)

A neutral base for your next creation - Alkaline is a modern Astro theme focused on developer experience and clean design.

## What is Alkaline?

Alkaline is an Astro-based theme that provides:

- 🎨 14 built-in color themes with dark/light mode support
- 📝 Blog and documentation setup out of the box
- 🔧 Minimal dependencies
- 🚀 SEO-friendly with Open Graph support
- ⚡️ Near Zero-JS by default (but JS-framework friendly)
- 📦 MDX support with syntax highlighting
- 🎯 TypeScript & Tailwind included
- 🍒 Statically generated with Astro, with a focus on developer experience and clean design

⚠️Thanks for checking out the Alkaline demo. I'm still making some minor changes and finishing up the docs. All the components curretnly have JSDocs and TypeScript types. It should be easy to pick up and use if you are familiar with Astro and Tailwind. I hope to have the whole project wrapped up and ready for public consumption around 2025-02-10.
